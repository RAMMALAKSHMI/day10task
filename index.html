                <h2>Rebel Poet</h2>
                <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam is the national poet of Bangladesh who is especially recognized as a Bidrohi
                    Kobi (rebel poet) around the country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of
                    Bangladesh. The famous poet Nazrul's writings deal with the revolution of that period of the
                    British government. His revolutionary attempt helped him to be a national poet of Bangladesh. He
                    has raised his voice against any kinds of fascism and oppression and got popularity swiftly
                    around the Indian Subcontinent.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Awesome Writer</h2>
                <p>Nazrul's writings explored themes such as love, freedom, humanity, and revolution. He opposed all
                    forms of bigotry and fundamentalism, including religious, caste-based and gender-based.
                    Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best known for his
                    songs and poems. He pioneered new music forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed
                    music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on HMV and gramophone records), collectively known
                    as Nazrul Geeti.</p>
